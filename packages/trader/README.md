- **Mobile-First Approach**: Consider mobile experience in all development decisions
- **Component Reusability**: Create reusable components that work across both interfaces
- **State Management**: Use MobX patterns consistently throughout the application

### Performance Standards

- **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for optimal performance
- **Bundle Optimization**: Keep bundle sizes minimal with proper splitting
- **State Efficiency**: Use selective observation to minimize re-renders
- **API Optimization**: Implement debounced proposals and efficient data fetching
